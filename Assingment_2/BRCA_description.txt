Dataset Description
This dataset contains clinical, molecular, and treatment-related information for patients diagnosed with breast cancer.
It integrates key features such as demographic details, tumor characteristics, protein biomarker levels, receptor statuses, surgical interventions, and patient outcomes. The data provides valuable insights into patient survival, tumor progression, and potential biomarkers,
making it suitable for survival analysis, predictive modeling, and biomarker discovery.

Key Aspects of the Dataset
Patient Demographics:

Includes age and gender information, offering insight into the patient population.
Protein Biomarker Levels:

Features (Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4) represent normalized expression levels of four proteins that may act as biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis.
 These values can help identify patterns related to tumor behavior or treatment response.
Tumor Characteristics:

Tumor stage (Tumour_Stage) and histology (Histology) classify the severity and type of cancer, providing critical data for clinical analysis.
Receptor Statuses:

Includes ER status, PR status, and HER2 status, indicating the presence or absence of specific hormone and growth factor receptors. 
These statuses are essential for determining treatment strategies (e.g., hormonal therapies or HER2-targeted drugs).
Surgical Treatments:

Information on the type of surgery performed (Surgery_type) helps study the impact of different surgical interventions on patient outcomes.
Follow-Up Data:

Date_of_Surgery and Date_of_Last_Visit allow tracking of the patient's journey post-treatment, 
enabling survival analysis and assessment of treatment effectiveness.
Patient Outcomes:

The Patient_Status column indicates whether a patient was alive or deceased during their last recorded follow-up, 
which is crucial for survival modeling and predictive analysis.
